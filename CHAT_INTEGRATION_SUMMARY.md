- `chat_overlay.dart` - Modal chat overlay (70% screen height)

#### Tests (test/)
- `chat_functionality_test.dart` - 17 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- `test_setup.dart` - Test utilities for mocking Flutter plugins

#### Configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables file for API key (added to .gitignore)

### Modified Files

1. **lib/main.dart**
   - Added flutter_dotenv import and initialization

   - Added chat imports (ChatBloc, widgets)
   - Modified floatingActionButton to display two stacked buttons (chat + prayer)
   - Added showModalBottomSheet for chat overlay

4. **pubspec.yaml**

   - Added flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0
   - Note: equatable was already present

5. **.gitignore**
   - Added `*.env` pattern to protect API keys

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Unit Tests: ✅ 17/17 PASSING
- ChatBloc initialization
- Load chat history (empty and populated)
- Send message (success and error scenarios)
- Clear chat functionality
- Message persistence to SharedPreferences
- ChatMessage model serialization/deserialization
- ChatMessage equality tests
- Event and State equality tests
- Service integration tests
- 50-message limit validation

### Code Quality
- ✅ `dart format .` - All files formatted (109 files, 0 changes needed)
- ✅ `dart analyze --fatal-infos` - No new issues introduced
- ✅ All new code follows existing patterns and conventions

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

The implementation follows the app's established architecture:

1. **BLoC Pattern**: Complete state management with events and states
2. **Provider Integration**: Works seamlessly with LocalizationProvider
3. **SharedPreferences**: Local persistence for chat history
4. **Material Design**: Consistent UI/UX matching app theme
5. **Equatable**: Proper equality comparisons for states and models
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with mocks

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

The chat assistant provides responses in all four supported languages:
- Spanish (es)
- English (en)
- Portuguese (pt)  
- French (fr)

Each language has culturally appropriate pastoral prompts for biblical guidance.

## 🔐 Security

- API keys stored in `.env` file
- `.env` excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Graceful degradation when API key is not configured
- Safe defaults for all operations

## 📱 User Experience

### Features Delivered
- ✅ Floating action button with chat bubble icon
- ✅ Modal overlay at 70% screen height
- ✅ Loading states with "Thinking..." indicator
- ✅ Auto-scroll to latest messages
- ✅ Message history persistence (limited to 50 messages)
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Two stacked floating buttons (chat above, prayer below)

### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated into existing DevocionalesPage
- No disruption to existing prayer button functionality
- Uses existing theme and color scheme
- Compatible with all existing features

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites for Production Use
1. Add valid Gemini API key to `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
2. Run `flutter pub get` if not already done
3. Test on target platforms (Android/iOS)

### Performance Considerations
- Chat history limited to 50 messages for optimal performance
- Messages saved asynchronously to avoid UI blocking
- Efficient state management with BLoC pattern
- Minimal memory footprint

## 📊 Dependencies Added

```yaml
google_generative_ai: ^0.4.3  # Gemini API integration
flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0         # Environment variable management
```

Note: `equatable: ^2.0.5` was already present in the project.
